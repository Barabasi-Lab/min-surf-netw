# min-surf-netw

QuadMeshNetworkPreset.nb:

This script sets up the topological and geometric characteristics for a physical network, including lists of nodes, links, their connectivities, and "sewing" information (e.g., which side and polarity of a sleeve boundary for each link is sewn to other links). The code can automatically generate this information for a spatially embedded network (provided by a .swc file). The outputs are saved as .mx files in the preset/ directory.

preset/:

This directory contains pre-generated network presets using QuadMeshNetworkPreset.nb. These presets are used in other scripts, such as QuadMeshNetwork_trifur_script.nb.

QuadMeshNetworkScript.wl:

This file includes all the necessary functions for building the QuadMesh and running the surface minimization.

QuadMeshNetwork_trifur_script.nb:

This script runs surface minimization for a trifurcation configuration. Execute the script line by line.

QuadMeshNetwork_bimodal_script.nb:

This script runs surface minimization for a bimodal-bifurcation configuration (i.e., bifurcation of two different link thicknesses). Execute the script line by line.

dÎ»/:

This directory contains the output files generated by QuadMeshNetwork_trifur_script.nb and QuadMeshNetwork_bimodal_script.nb.
